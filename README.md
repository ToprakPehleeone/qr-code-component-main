## Overview
  A basic landing page with QR-Code. 

  A good challenge for aligning items in HTML and CSS

## My process

  Building my first project was fun. I've been watching HTML and CSS videos and boothcamps for awhile and puting everything i've learned to a test was challenging. 

  During my process of trying to create a qr-code landing page, i must admit i got stuck quite a bit. But i guess thats the part of learning. 

  I have tried to use Semantic HTML with basic CSS properties but in the end i've decided to use flex-box in CSS. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

With using CSS Flex and Basic HTML i could create a similar version of qr code example. Aligning some items took a bit of time and thought process. Which was helpful to grasp the basics. 







### Continued development

Aligning some items while writing clean and useful code was challenging. I want to improve the understanding of designing with minimum and adaptive code. 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.php) - This helped me for aligning qr-image.
